# Modern Android Development Example
This is an Example application which demonstrate how you can use modern android development components such as Coroutines, Flows, LiveData, Hilt, Room, Work Manager, Alarm Manager, Notification & etc.
This example also demonstrate how you can write Unit test, UI test, Database test.
This app is completely written by me. If you have any suggestion feel free to fork!

## Tech Used
Programming Language: Kotlin
Architecture: MVVM
Libraries: Retrofit, Kotlin Coroutines, Kotlin Flows, Navigation Component, LiveData, Hilt, Work Manager, Alarm Manager, Room, Glide, ExoPlayer & etc

### Reasons for using Single Activity:
- Smoother Navigation through Navigation Component
- Re-usability such as MatchesFragment used for showing all matches and team matches 
- Mostly used approach in modern android development
- Other benefits: Efficient Memory Usage, Backstack Management, Performance, Simplified Communication, Easier Transition to Jetpack Navigation and many more

### Reason for using MVVM:
- It best suits for the sample application
- Most popular and modern choice for android development
- Better Testability than other architecture
- Better Lifecycle management
- Great compatibility with Android Architecture Component like LiveData, ViewModel

### Reason for using Navigation Component:
- As already decided to develop Single Activity app
- Simplified navigation flow
- Easier to communicate between views

### Reason for using Kotlin Coroutines:
- Best practice and standard for modern android app development
- Kotlin first approach
- Top choice for handle threads
- Great readability & simplicity
- No headache of callback
- Asynchronous made easy :)

### Reason for using Kotlin flow:
- Kotlin way to do reactive programming
- Handy functions
- Easy to handle sequences of data 
- Great integration with coroutines
- Can prevent data overload

### Reason for using Live Data:
- Integration with View Model
- Easy to retrieve most recent data
- It provides real time updates

### Reason for using Hilt:

- Official android support
- Integration with Jetpack
- Less boiler-plate code make codebase more clean

### Reason for using Retrofit:
- As the sample app required to call network api retrofit library is the most standard library to handle network calls
- Great integration with coroutines and flows
- Data parsing is easier

### Reason for using Room:

- Modern mobile apps should not show empty app while there is no network or slow network
- Standard library for android offline support
- It will provide faster data loading which will be great UX

### Reason for using WorkManager:
- Schedule local database clean for after X days

### Reason for Using Glide:

- Render team logo on the app
- Easy catching

### Reason for using ExoPlayer:
- To play previous match highlights from network
- Maintained by google
- Highly customizable
